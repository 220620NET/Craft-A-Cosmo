# About
Cosminis are a recent hit involving digital companions that users interact with and care for in a social media setting. With the rise in popularity of this sensation; our store provides fans a way to bring the online experience into their homes in the form of cute plushies themed to each character. On our website each user can register and browse a unique collection of cosmini stuffed animals and place orders to be delivered straight to their home. Our application plans to feature an exciting "construct-your-own" tool, where
users can craft their own special cosmini; and add personal flair to each item shipped!
